Index 0 is your current page. If you revisit the a page that is already in your recents, it will not duplicate that page in your recents, but instead move it to index 0.

The top bar has a max width, but when it overflows, it is horizontally scrollable using the mousewheel. Currently, the extension displays your last 15 page/block visits. 

- If recent visit is a page, the recent link will display as that page's title, truncated to 25 characters.
- If recent visit is your Daily Notes, the recent link will display as "Daily Notes", prefixed with an orange ‚úπ.
- If recent visit is your Graph Overview, the recent link will display as "Graph", prefixed with üï∏Ô∏è.
- If recent visit is your All Pages, the recent link will display as "Search", prefixed with üîé.
- If recent visit is a focused block, the recent link will display as that block's content, truncated to 20 characters and prefixed with a blue üûá.

## Roadmap

- make the options configurable by the user, namely:
  * adjust the number of recent links displayed in top bar
  * better top bar width control so as not to interfere with other top bar elements
  * change placement/layout of the recent links display (left sidebar?)
  * customizable hotkeys to trigger links
  * customizable styling for the top bar
- add ability to open links in sidebar using hotkeys only (no clicks)
- add button for clearing recents completely
